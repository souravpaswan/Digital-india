        INFORMATION HUB ABOUT THE DIGITAL INDIA INITIATIVE
    </h1> </br>
    <div class="container">
        <h1> Why Digital India?</h1>
        <p class="p1">
            →This is the main motive for digital India. Digital India will bring this world in the hands of Indian.
            Digital India is a campaign launched by the Government of India in order to ensure the Government's
            services are made available to citizens electronically by improved online infrastructure and
            by increasing Internet connectivity or making the country digitally empowered in the field of
            technology. Each and every Indian now can access from his/her sofa or dining or comfort.
        </p> </br>
        <h2>Removal of Black Economy </h2>
        <p class="p1">
            →All the online transaction can be monitored easily and every payment made by
            any customer to any merchant will be recorded, this way there won’t be any
            illegal transactions and it’ll be impossible for people to hide their money. By
            restricting the cash-based transactions and using only digital payments, the
            government can efficiently expel the black economy.
        </p> </br>
        <h2>Increase in Revenues</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            →Another big advantage of digital India is that as the transactions get digitized,
            monitoring the sales and taxes becomes much more convenient, as the
            transactions are recorded, customers will now get a bill for every purchase that
            they make and merchants can now no longer escape from paying tax to the
            government, this results in increases of revenue of the government – thus
            resulting in growth of the overall financial status of the country.
        </p> </br>
        <h2> Empowerment of People</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            →One of the biggest advantages of Digital India is that it gives an empowerment
            to the citizens. When the payments move digital, each and every individual is
            bound to have a bank account, a mobile phone, etc. This way, the government
            can easily transfer the subsidies directly to Aadhaar-linked bank accounts of
            people. In short, people no longer have to wait to receive the incentives and
            subsidies that they are bound to receive from the government. This feature is
            already in place in most cities. One example of this feature is LPG subsidy that
            government gives to the common people. This subsidy payment is now done via
            bank transfers these days.
        </p> </br>
        <h2>Paves the way to e-Governance</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            →E-governance is a huge plus point for all the citizens, it is quicker, faster and
            safer when compared to traditional governance, with the help of e-governance,
            you can now get anything from birth certificate to death certificate immediately,
            this is convenient for people to access the information they need on the go.
        </p> </br>
        <h2> Creation of New Jobs</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            →With the initiative of Digital India, there have been numerous ways to enhance
            job opportunities in new markets as well as increasing employment opportunities
            in existing markets, new markets have started hiring people, thus increasing the
            employment rate.
